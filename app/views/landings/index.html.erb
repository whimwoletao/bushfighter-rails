<br><b>ABOUT PAINTBALL</b>
<br>Paintball is played in over 40 countries by millions of Men and Women of all ages and lifestyles. An exercise that is best for burning calorie, keeping fit and having fun.
Paintballs come in rainbow of bright colors, green, blue, yellow, pink and more. When a paintball tags a player, the thin gelatin skin splits open, and the liquid inside leaves a bright ‘’paint’’ mark. A player who is marked is eliminated from the game.
<br>
<br><b>ABOUT OUR TALLY BOARD</b>
<br>The saying goes “give honor to which honor is due”. Bush Fighters Paintball Club adopts a customized tally board system used to recognize outstanding performances during the game. We award points for ‘headshot’ and ‘body shot’ which combines to produce ‘total kills’. All participants have an equal opportunity to have their name recorded on the tally board buy having at least one clean shot on either of an opponent’s kill spot (head and body) during the game.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>ABOUT WAIVER</b>
<br>Everyone must sign a waiver form before admittance.
Player must be 10 years of age or above to qualify to play paintball on our field. Minors (18 years below) must have the waiver form signed by their parents or guardian on or before the day of play.

<h5 class="text-center"><b>PAINT CHECK</b></h5>

<br>When a paintball hits a player and is not sure where he may call for a paint check on him by yelling “paint check me” and continue to play. A referee will check the player  for a hit,  When the referee steps close or place his hand on a player, he becomes neutral, he cannot be out,  opposite players cannot fire at him because he is neutral. Neutral players should duck except asked otherwise by the referee, players may not move to improve their position on neutral players. Once the paint check is over, the referee will call the player in or out.
<br>A player is also allowed to call a paint check on another player if he is sure that such player has been hit or marked. To do this, the player calling the paint check should shout “paint check”, followed by the description and location of the player to be checked. (E.g. Paint check the guy to my left, guy at sniper post, lady at the tire etc. or call out the number on the obstacle, e.g.  “Check 4”). This is to create a quicker response. If players just call out “paint check” without giving a precise location the referee might not do so. Also if paint checks are called excessively or needlessly the referee may eliminate the player calling the checks. When calling a paint check on a player, you are not to move on that player, but you can continue to fire, but must stop firing as soon as you see the referee step close to check him because he neutral during the check. However, you should continue battling other opposite players while paying attention to the referee verdict on the neutral player. After checking, the referee will notify the shooter if who he called a paint check on is out or still in the game, by shouting “no shot”, “splash”, “shot” etc. If the player being checked is out, the referee will ask him to leave the playing area, if he is not out the referee will say “no shot” and step away from the checked player. Then the shooter can continue to battle the former neutral player. Players must also tell players who you believe, you have shot to check themselves by shouting ‘’Check yourself please’’ e.g. paint check your abdomen.



<h5 class="text-center"><b>SURRENDER OPTION</b></h5>
In situation when you find an opponent in disadvantageous position. (i.e.:  you are 10ft. or less from a player with no idea you are there), you should give that player a chance to surrender rather than shooting at close range. Call out “Surrender” if he responds in an aggressive manner or try to shoot you, you may shoot, no multiple shots. Players may call out ‘I Surrender’ to avoid being shot at. Player not making any response or those who try to bluff would be shot.

<h5 class="text-center"><b>FIELD AND PAINT POLICY</b></h5>

Corporate outings are a great way to build team morale among co-workers. Playing paintball as a group and having a fun time together will create a team building experience that is difficult to match with other sports. A football outing is great, but typically, not all staff members own a boot, let alone have the fitness requirement needed to play football. The great thing about paintball is that there is no particular skill set required of a player, and both men and women of all ages and fitness levels can battle on an equal ground. Our experienced staff will work with your company to build a customized experience suited for your specific needs. The bonds that are built will bring your company closer than ever before.

<h5 class="text-center"><b>SCHOOL TRIPS</b></h5>
Paintball is a great school outing or field trip. At Bush Fighters Paintball Club, we are always devising ways to teach kids how to build a healthy interaction and co-operation with one another. Paintball will improve their overall fitness level thereby making them active, it will also teach them teamwork and sportsmanship. This will give kids a chance to express themselves in real life rather than through video games alone. 
<h5 class="text-center"><b>LOW IMPACT PAINTBALL FOR KIDS </b></h5>
<br>Our game types can also be enjoyed with low impact paintballs. Low impact paintball is ideally structured to cater to a very specific demographic of the paintball community, namely kids, new players, ladies and guys who may be hesitant about playing paintball, this is made possible by using a defined equipment that shoots smaller paintballs (50 calibre paintball) at lower rapidity which in turns produces a softer impact and produces very less or no pain.
Some of the benefits of the paintball soft format include:
<br>1.  Less weight per ball, this means less impact on player. 
<br>2.  Lighter equipment to lessen the load on players.
<br>Our Low impact paintball Package has a special flat rate of 50,000 per group; you can make payments before time to reserve your space. Included in the package is the following:

<br>•   Entrance for 10 Players
<br>•   2 Hours of Private game
<br>•   All of the Rental Equipment Needed to Play
<br>•   2,000 rounds per team (50 calibre paintballs).
This is a fixed package so no falling short of the 10 players does not attract extra fees or penalty. Any player above the included 10 will be charged 4,000 per person and includes field entry, rental equipment and 100 paintballs. If your group is going to be substantially large, please call us directly so we can cater for your specific needs.

<h5 class="text-center"><b>Game Scenarios</b><h5>
These are examples of some of the scenario games Bush Fighters Paintball Club offers. There are many variations to these games and our staffs we will suggests variations. We are also very opened to players’ suggestions.
<br>Elimination
There are two teams whose objective is to eliminate everyone on the opposite team, if you are shot on the kill spot, you are out.
<br>Capture the Flag
The objective is to capture the opponent’s flag and return it to your base before the opponent captures your flag and takes it back to their base.
<br>President
The first Team plays with a small squad of secret service agents they will try to move the President from one base to another while the other team plays the assassins with a mission of capturing or assassinating the President.
<br>Mercenary
This game is similar to capture the flag, but on the field is a third team of mercenaries stationed strategically, attacking both sides. They cannot capture any flags and cannot emerge as winners. They are just hindrance to the other teams’ progress.
<br>Markswoman
This game will have female snipers stationed around their flag station, the objective of the game is for the men to start from their own base, unarmed, try to infiltrate the enemies’ territory and attempt to capture the enemies’ flag and take it to their base without getting shot. The ladies try to protect their flag but cannot move from their position.
<br>Disarm the Bomb
One team will be the bomb squad, and the other will be the terrorists. The bomb squad will try to disarm a bomb, which will go off in a defined amount of time. However, the Bomb Squad needs a code to diffuse the bomb, which is in the possession of the terrorists. The team that plays terrorists may place the bomb anywhere on the field, but it must be accessible to the Bomb Squad. If a terrorist is shot, he is considered to be captured, and he must tell the Bomb Squad the code to disable the bomb. The Bomb Squad must reach the bomb before the time limit is up, or else the game is lost. If all of the Bomb Squad is killed, then the game is also considered to be over. Even if all of the terrorists die, the game still does not end until the Bomb Squad gets to the bomb with the code. 
<br><b>NB. The Bomb Squad can have a technician, who the Bomb Squad must protect if they want to disable the bomb.</b>
Scramble
<br>This game is called scramble because that is what players will do as they try to organize themselves before the other team players do. In order to play, players are to start at their base without a maker or paintballs. Paintballs and markers of both teams would be stationed at opposite sides of the field away from each other.
    When the game starts, players of the same team must run and find where supplies are kept, they then trade supplies so that they can now fight the other team.
    As soon as you have what you need, you may fire on the opposite team.
<br>Predator vs. Prey
One team would be predator while the other will be prey. If a predator is shot, they are out of the game. If a prey is shot, they become part of the predator’s team. The game ends when all predators are shot or when all prey becomes predator.
<br>V.I.P
In this game, each team chooses a VIP. Your goal is to kill the other team’s VIP. The game ends when one of the VIP’s is killed or everyone on the opposite team is eliminated. Note that the VIP could be armed or unarmed depending on the variation of the game.

<br><h5 class="text-center"><b>What should I wear?</b></h5>
<br>We suggest you wear full clothing that covers as much exposed skin as possible. Long sleeves, sweat shirts, sweat pants, jean and good running shoes or high top for good ankle support would do great.
<br><h5 class="text-center"><b>Does getting shot with paintball hurt?</b></h5>
    <br>It depends greatly on the speed of the balls, how close up, and the amount of clothing. Generally it is like getting a good smack from a dry towel or getting snapped by a rubber band. 
    <br><h5 class="text-center"><b> Does the paint wash off?</b></h5>
    Yes. Our paint can be washed out of clothing.
<br><h5 class="text-center"><b>Is it dangerous?</b></h5>
<br>Just as any other physical sports, there is a possibility of an accident. As long as proper safety rules and regulations are followed, paintball could be one of the safest sports.

<br><h5 class="text-center"><b>How old do you have to be to play?</b></h5>
   <br> Our standard age is 10. We also look at the level of maturity; the face mask must fit on the head of the player irrespective of the age. Players below 18 years must have the waiver form signed by their parents or guardian before playing. The form can be filled ahead of time and brought to the field on game day. The form can be found on our website.
<br><h5 class="text-center"><b>Can I bring my own paint?</b></h5>
    Noooo.
    BushFighters Paintball Club is field paint only.

<br><h2 class="text-center"><b>ADVICE TO NEW PLAYERS</b></h2>
<br>Pay Attention: Do not focus your vision a single spot or opponent because other opponents may be flanking you.
<br>Communicate With Your Team: Paintball is a team sport and teams tend to be more successful when effective communication is being utilized especially when executing maneuvers.
<br>Use the Element of Surprise: The element of surprise can be used in several ways. One common method is to appear from behind one part of an obstacle and take a couple of shots, hide and move to the other part of the obstacle and take other shots. Your opponent is likely to expect a shot from where you used to be so you can pop up from your new position and hit him.
<br>Stay with Teammates: Sticking with teammates creates room for more options as opposed to doing it alone.
Leave Enemies Heads Down: You can try to shoot at opponents from one position and then move to another position while opponents are behind cover in order to buy yourself more time.
<br>Move: Staying in the same position for a long time will get you noticed and the opposite team will easily flank you. Don’t be afraid to advance to appoint where you will be of greater use to your team.
<br>Sometimes Play Cool: Sometimes when you get to a new position do not reveal your position immediately. Rather. Take some seconds to study the playing area from where you are, identify if you need to move to another position or if opponents re within range.
<br>Stealth Mode: In some games, aggressive tactics may work. On the other hand, making use of some diversionary tactics and moving stealthy can be advantageous in many games.
<br>Analyze the Field: Always try to stay ahead of the enemy on the field. Create a mental picture of where enemies are, where they might move to, what is their next move, what the best course of action for you and your team might be and where would be the best point to retreat to.
<br>Keep Things Simple: You do not have to do to do too much, keep things simple and work with your team.
